# Spotify-Scraper
This repo uses a Python Spotify Web API called Spotipy. Hoping to use this api in conjunction with an LED array to make a led image of currently playing tracks on my account to add ambience to shower concerts. A similar project has been done using Arduino IDE. https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/live-spotify-album-art-display/all
